# Floor Tile Blending Feature üé®

## Overview
Added seamless blending for floor tiles to create smooth, professional-looking transitions between different floor tile types. This creates more natural-looking maps where tiles blend together rather than having hard edges.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üîÄ **Smart Tile Blending**
- **Automatic Detection**: Analyzes neighboring tiles to determine where blending should occur
- **Directional Blending**: Supports blending in all 8 directions (N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW)
- **Priority-Based**: Higher priority tiles blend over lower priority tiles for natural layering

### üéØ **Floor-Specific Focus**
- **Floor Tiles Only**: Blending applies specifically to floor tiles as requested
- **Wall Separation**: Wall tiles maintain crisp edges for architectural clarity
- **Layer Isolation**: Blending doesn't interfere with other layers (walls, objects, assets)

### ‚ö° **Performance Optimized**
- **Cached Blend Masks**: Pre-computed edge masks for fast rendering
- **Off-screen Compositing**: Efficient canvas operations for smooth blending
- **Viewport Culling**: Only processes visible tiles for better performance

## üéÆ **How to Use**

1. **Enable/Disable**: Check "Floor Tile Blending" in the Grid and Snap Settings section
2. **Paint Floor Tiles**: Use different floor tile types (grass, stone, wood, cobblestone)
3. **Automatic Blending**: Adjacent compatible tiles will blend smoothly
4. **Toggle Anytime**: Can be turned on/off without affecting existing tiles

## üîß **Tile Compatibility Groups**

### **Natural Terrain**
- `grass` ‚Üí Blends with stone floors

### **Stone-Based Floors**  
- `floor-stone-rough`
- `floor-stone-smooth` 
- `floor-cobblestone`
- All stone types blend with each other and with grass

### **Wood-Based Floors**
- `floor-wood-planks` ‚Üí Blends with stone floors

### **Blending Priority** (Higher numbers dominate)
1. `grass` (Priority: 1)
2. `floor-stone-rough` (Priority: 2)  
3. `floor-stone-smooth` (Priority: 3)
4. `floor-cobblestone` (Priority: 4)
5. `floor-wood-planks` (Priority: 5)

## üõ†Ô∏è **Implementation Details**

### **Core Files Added/Modified**
- `src/services/tileBlending.ts` - Blending algorithm and mask generation
- `src/utils/tileRenderer.ts` - Enhanced rendering with blend support
- `src/uiStore.ts` - Added blending toggle state
- `src/pages/Game.tsx` - UI toggle and blend-aware rendering

### **Key Functions**
- `analyzeTileBlending()` - Detects neighboring tiles and blend requirements
- `renderTileWithBlending()` - Renders tiles with smooth edge transitions
- `getCachedBlendMask()` - Efficient mask caching for performance
- `canTilesBlend()` - Compatibility checking between tile types

### **Blending Algorithm**
1. **Neighbor Analysis**: Check all 8 directions around each floor tile
2. **Compatibility Check**: Verify tiles can blend based on type groups
3. **Priority Resolution**: Higher priority tiles blend over lower priority
4. **Mask Generation**: Create directional gradient masks for smooth transitions
5. **Composite Rendering**: Blend tiles using off-screen canvas composition

## üé® **Visual Examples**

### **Before Blending**
```
[Grass][Grass][Stone][Stone]
[Grass][Grass][Stone][Stone]  
[Wood ][Wood ][Stone][Stone]
[Wood ][Wood ][Stone][Stone]
```
*Hard edges between different tile types*

### **After Blending**
```
[Grass~~~~Stone][Stone]
[Grass~~~~Stone][Stone]  
[Wood~~~~~Stone][Stone]
[Wood~~~~~Stone][Stone]
```
*Smooth gradual transitions using priority-based blending*

## üöÄ **Benefits**

‚úÖ **Professional Look**: Smooth, natural-looking floor transitions  
‚úÖ **Easy to Use**: Automatic blending with simple on/off toggle  
‚úÖ **Performance Friendly**: Cached masks and optimized rendering  
‚úÖ **Flexible**: Works with existing tiles and new imported tiles  
‚úÖ **Non-Destructive**: Can be disabled without losing tile data  

## üîÆ **Future Enhancements**
- Custom blend curves for different tile combinations
- Blend strength adjustment slider
- Support for walls and objects blending (if needed)
- Import custom blend masks for special tile types

The floor tile blending system creates beautiful, seamless transitions that make maps look more professional and natural! üé®‚ú®
