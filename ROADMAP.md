## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture Considerations

### State Management
- Extend current Zustand stores for new features  
- Implement feature-specific stores (*asset-store, export-store*, etc.)  
- Maintain backward compatibility  

### Performance
- Implement virtual rendering early to handle large maps  
- Use Web Workers for heavy computations (generation, export)  
- Optimize asset loading and caching  

### File Formats
- Standardize project file format for cross-compatibility  
- Support for importing industry-standard formats  
- Version migration system for file compatibility
