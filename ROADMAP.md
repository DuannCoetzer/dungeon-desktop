## üöÄ Quick Wins (Completed!)

1. ‚úÖ **Grid snapping for assets** - Extend existing grid system
2. ‚úÖ **Asset auto-scaling** - Add to current asset placement logic
3. ‚úÖ **Basic import functionality** - Extend current asset loading
4. ‚úÖ **Simple export options** - Canvas-to-image conversion
5. ‚úÖ **Layer visibility toggles** - Extend current layer system

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture Considerations

### State Management
- Extend current Zustand stores for new features
- Implement feature-specific stores (asset-store, export-store, etc.)
- Maintain backward compatibility

### Performance
- Implement virtual rendering early to handle large maps
- Use Web Workers for heavy computations (generation, export)
- Optimize asset loading and caching

### File Formats
- Standardize project file format for cross-compatibility
- Support for importing industry-standard formats
- Version migration system for file compatibility

## üìä Success Metrics

- **User Adoption**: Active users creating and sharing maps
- **Performance**: Smooth editing of maps up to 100x100 grid
- **Export Quality**: Professional-grade output suitable for print
- **Community**: User-generated assets and templates
- **Cross-Platform**: Consistent experience across all platforms

## üéØ Competitive Analysis
