# Tauri Save/Load Integration Summary

## Completed Implementation

I have successfully integrated Tauri IPC commands with the protocol's `serializeMap`/`deserializeMap` functions and wired up file dialogs to work with JSON and the MapStore. Here's what was implemented:

## 1. Backend (Rust) Implementation

### Added Dependencies (src-tauri/Cargo.toml)
- `tauri-plugin-dialog = "2"` - For file dialogs
- `tauri-plugin-fs = "2"` - For file system access

### IPC Commands (src-tauri/src/lib.rs)
- `open_file_dialog()` - Shows open file dialog with JSON filter
- `save_file_dialog()` - Shows save file dialog with default filename
- `read_file(file_path)` - Reads file contents from disk
- `write_file(file_path, contents)` - Writes contents to file
- `load_map()` - Combined dialog + read operation
- `save_map(map_data)` - Combined dialog + write operation

### Configuration (src-tauri/tauri.conf.json)
Added plugin permissions for dialog and filesystem access.

## 2. Protocol Enhancement (src/protocol.ts)

### New Methods Added to MapProtocol Class
- `serializeMap()` - Exports map data as formatted JSON with metadata
- `deserializeMap(json)` - Imports and validates map data from JSON
- Both include proper error handling and data validation

### External Functions
- `serializeMap()` - Public interface to serialize current map
- `deserializeMap(json)` - Public interface to deserialize map data

## 3. Frontend Service Layer (src/services/tauri.ts)

### Tauri Service Wrapper
- `openFileDialog()` - Shows file picker dialog
- `saveFileDialog()` - Shows save dialog
- `readFile(path)` - Reads file contents
- `writeFile(path, contents)` - Writes file contents
- `loadMapFromFile()` - Complete load operation with protocol integration
- `saveMapToFile()` - Complete save operation with protocol integration
- `loadMap()` - Alternative load method
- `saveMap()` - Alternative save method
- `exportMapData()` - Export current map as JSON string
- `importMapData(json)` - Import map from JSON string

## 4. MapStore Integration (src/mapStore.ts)

### New MapStore Methods
- `saveMapToFile()` - Async method to save current map
- `loadMapFromFile()` - Async method to load map from file
- Both methods properly integrated with protocol functions

## 5. UI Component (src/components/FileOperationsPanel.tsx)

### File Operations Panel
- Save Map button with loading state
- Load Map button with loading state
- Status feedback with success/error/cancelled states
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Auto-clearing status messages

### Integration with Game Page (src/pages/Game.tsx)
Added FileOperationsPanel to the sidebar in the Game page.

## 6. Package Dependencies (package.json)

Added `@tauri-apps/api@^2.7.0` for frontend Tauri API access.

## Key Features

### Data Flow
1. **Save**: MapStore ‚Üí Protocol.serializeMap() ‚Üí Tauri Service ‚Üí IPC ‚Üí Rust Backend ‚Üí File Dialog ‚Üí File Write
2. **Load**: File Dialog ‚Üí File Read ‚Üí Rust Backend ‚Üí IPC ‚Üí Tauri Service ‚Üí Protocol.deserializeMap() ‚Üí MapStore

### Error Handling
- File dialog cancellation handling
- File I/O error handling
- JSON parsing error handling
- Data validation during deserialization

### Data Validation
- Ensures required map structure exists
- Validates layer structure
- Sets default values for missing fields
- Preserves existing data integrity

### User Experience
- File dialogs with appropriate filters (.json files)
- Default filename for saves ("dungeon_map.json")
- Loading states during operations
- Success/error feedback
- Non-blocking operations

## File Format

The saved JSON files include:
- Complete tile data for all layers (floor, walls, objects, assets)
- Asset instance data with positions and properties
- Metadata (version, creation date, export date)
- Pretty-formatted JSON for readability

## Testing Status

- ‚úÖ Rust compilation passes
- ‚úÖ TypeScript interfaces compile correctly
- ‚úÖ Dependencies properly installed
- ‚úÖ File operations integrated with protocol
- ‚ùå Full application build has unrelated TypeScript errors in examples

## Usage

Users can now:
1. Click "üíæ Save Map" to export their current dungeon to a JSON file
2. Click "üìÅ Load Map" to import a previously saved dungeon
3. See status feedback for all operations
4. Cancel dialogs without affecting the current map
5. Files are saved in a structured, readable JSON format

The integration successfully bridges the gap between the frontend MapStore, the protocol serialization functions, and Tauri's file system capabilities.
